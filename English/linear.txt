Hi. This is the first lecture in MIT's course 18.06, linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang.
大家好，这里是麻省理工学院线性代数课程（代码为18.06）的第一节课，我是吉尔波特-斯特朗。
The text for the course is this book, Introduction on Linear Algebre.
这门课的教材是这本书——《线性代数导论》
And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises from the past, MatLba codes, the syllabus for the course, is web.mit.edu/18.06.
这门课的网页上有大量的练习题、matlba代码和教学大纲，网址是web.mit.edu/18.06.
And this is the first lecture, lecture one.
这是第一讲，Lecture 1。
So, and later we'll give the web address for viewing these, videotapes.
等会，我们会给出观看录像的网页地址。
Okay, so what's in the first lecture? This is my plan.
好了，所以第一讲，讲什么呢？这是我的计划。
The fundamental problem fo linear algebra, which is to solve a system of linear equations.
讲线性代数的基本问题，求解线性方程组。
So, let's start with a case when we have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns.
所以，让我们开始先从一个例子入手，当我们有了一些方程，假设是n个方程和n个未知数。
So an equal number of equations and unknowns.
方程和未知数的数量相等。
That's the normal, nice case.
这便是最正常最友好的情况。
And what I want to do is -- with examples, of course -- to describe, first, what I call the Row picture.
当然我想先举例来说明“行图像”。
That's the picture of one equation at a time.
这是每次只有一个方程的图像。
It's the picture you've seen before in two by two equations where lines meet.
这是你以前见过的两两线性相交的方程。
So in a minute, you'll see lines meeting.
马上，你就会看见（这种线性相交）。
The second picture, I'll put a star beside that,
because that's such an important one.
然后，我会在图像那标一个星号，因为它很重要。
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
你们可能是第一次见到“列图像”。
And those are the rows and column of a matrix.
它们是行和列的矩阵。
So the third -- the algebra way to look at the problem is the matirx form and using a matrix that I'll call A.
最后，看待问题的代数方法是矩阵，用一个被我称为A的矩阵。
Okay, so can I do an example? The whole semester will be examples and then see what's going on with the example.
我可以举一个例子吗？这整个学期会有很多的例子，来看看这些例子是怎么回事吧。
So, take an example. Two equations, two unknowns.
好，举个例子。两个方程，两个未知数。
